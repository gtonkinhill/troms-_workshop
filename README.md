# Troms√∏ Microbial Genomics Workshop

This repository includes the exercises and some example data that we will use as part of the workshop. The Rmd files are split into those with and without code. If you are fairly confident with R, I recommend trying the exercises without looking at the answers. You can compare your output with that in the answer html files. If you are less confident with R, feel free to look at the answers as you go. We will try and work in small groups.
